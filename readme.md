# API Suggestions
* Documentation
* No Patch
* Not a subdomain
* Date would probably be better as UNIX

**Objective:** `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` books using AJAX and Handlebars templating.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.
2. Follow the challenges from the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-03-restful-server-express/day-01" target="_blank">CRUD and RESTful Resources</a> modules. By the end of the challenges, **a user should be able to:**
  * See a list of all books
  * Create a new book
  * Read a book :)
  * Update an existing book
  * Delete an existing book
3. Make sure to take advantage of Bootstrap for a good UX.

## Homework

While you're developing a library, treat it as a real-world project. As you run into issues with our API add them to a list of problems.

You're required to keep a list of 5 issues which caused friction for you while using our API. An example could be "I found it difficult to find documentation on what was returned from the API".
                                                                                                                                               With your problems in hand, read <a href="https://github.com/gocardless/http-api-design" target="_blank">HTTP API Design Resources</a> and see if anything is covered in that github document.

Prove to us you've read the document by including your list of 5 issues and any supporting references from the document in your submission pull request.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* At the end of the day, once you've finished the **challenges from both modules**, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
